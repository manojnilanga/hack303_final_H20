Hi Taoufiq,

We have been in touch with our system suppliers who have analysed this flight in detail. Essentially the problem is caused by an incorrect use of a group code within the PNL. There are multiple groups all sharing the code C2 which is not correct.

I believe we are continuing to have issues with this and it all centres around the PNL composition prior to transmission. I wonder if you can investigate with your IT suppliers?

I have attached the full response for your reference however if you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.

Hi Murray,

Re: Incident report # 12350 - L-DCS STN - MAC492/24Jun PNL

We have investigated the reported issue and found the cause to be a formatting issue with the PNL.

Extract from PNL PART 01:

1DAVIES/FATIMAMRS-C2 .L/10082026
.R/PSPT HK1 ////-1DAVIES/FATIMAMRS
1DAVIESBRAZIL/NOORALICECHD-C2
.R/PSPT HK1 ////-1DAVIESBRAZIL/NOORALICECHD

Extract from PNL PART 02:

-TNG53Y
1AARAB/HANANEMRS-C2 .L/10068616


Extract from PNL PART 03:

1ELALAMI/MAYAMISS-C2

So there are four passenger with the same group code. Also the group code C2 indicates there are only two passengers in the group!

Passenger booked on the above mentioned flight under PNR 16925982 purchased seat number 1A along with his ticket. However, we' were not able to give the same seat to the pax since he didn't have a name on SDCS system although he is a confirmed pax therefore the seat was not protected in the system but was appearing as available hence was utilized by another pax. Same has created a seating conflict onboard and resulted in delaying the flight for 10m.

The PNL of the above mentioned flight was not downloaded completely onto the SDCS system i.e. out of 160 pax booked we had around 84 names reflecting in the system only meaning we had to accept the rest of the pax (around 74) as no-rec!!

Appreciate if you can investigate the matter and find out what went wrong.

Best regards

On 09Mar09, BAH flight (G9105) was delayed 10m due to offloading 10 joining pax from SHJ as they were showing as inbound from TRV in the SDCS system which was coming late after the departure time of BAH flight, Details and PNR's are listed below.

The above mentioned flight incurred a 04 min delay due reservation

error. There were a group of 05 psgrs;
1. Abdulla ahmed/Rashed seq 105 pnr 16723408
2. Ahmedali/Saeed seq 106 pnr 16723408
3. Jumamohammed seq 107 pnr 16723408
4. Alhayaki seq 095 pnr 16723408
5. Tarroza seq 96 pnr 16723408

All of the above psgrs are under the same pnr and local joining but had
inbound showing from G9442/09mar09 ex-TRV. Today due to fog disruptions
we had several psgrs misconnected due late inbound of aircrafts. The TRV
flight was only due in at 1810 Lt and the departure of the G9105/09mar09
SHJ-BAH is 1715 lt. As advised the transfer desk had offloaded all the
transfer psgrs from TRV due misconnection. Unfortunately, these 05 psgrs
were also offloaded due since showing on the inbound from TRV list. 

Later at the gate the psgrs had to be re-instated In the system to be
accepted which caused a delay o 04 min. Appreciate if you could get in
touch with your IT departments to resolve this reservation error.

=========================================================================
ISA Observations (Indika/Janaki)
- When the PNL/ADL checked, there were 1 PNL and 12 ADL's sent for G9105 flight. 
As per the PNL, Above mentioned PNR had 4 PAX connecting from TRV. So the PNL is correctly showing the connection details for the PNR. 
And PAX in this PNR were grouped as B4

Later in 2 ADL's 2 sets of other PAX were sent with same character group id.
ie; 3 PAX from 1 PNR sent as Group B3
2 PX from 1 PNR as Group B2
Both of above PNRs are SHJ/BAH

As PAX group code should be unique, we seems to have made a mistake by assigning B2, B3 & B4 within the same flight. 
DCS has replaced the B4 group PNR PAX details with B2 & B3 group pax details.

Dear Mr. Byond,



Passenger booked on the above mentioned flight under PNR 16925982 purchased seat number 1A along with his ticket. However, we' were not able to give the same seat to the pax since he didn't have a name on SDCS system although he is a confirmed pax therefore the seat was not protected in the system but was appearing as available hence was utilized by another pax. Same has created a seating conflict onboard and resulted in delaying the flight for 10m.



The PNL of the above mentioned flight was not downloaded completely onto the SDCS system i.e. out of 160 pax booked we had around 84 names reflecting in the system only meaning we had to accept the rest of the pax (around 74) as no-rec!!



Appreciate if you can investigate the matter and find out what went wrong.

Dear Indika,
Please note on G9 506/09JAN CMB/SHJ flight also the manifest was released for only half the booked
pax. The book load was 118 the PNL was released for only 59 pax.
When trying to release the PNL system generates the comment ""PNL parts missing.""
I feel this could not be due to a SITA address failure as in that case PNL's for all flights must have problems
however its only a few flights that we are experiencing this problem with, it seems to me like one individual 
is not using the correct method of releasing the PNL to the system, however in that case at least some other
stations too should experience the same problem.
This have been a pressing problem for us for some time now and even our GHA is complaining of the inconvenience
of some times having to zero in half the flight and some times the complete flight due to the PNL not due'ly transferring
in to the DCS system.
Thanks for your cooperation in trying to solve this problem, 
Brgds; Darel.

Hi Darel,



FYI.

As per below checked by Byorn from ISA, this is due to SITA address failure, and it was fixed now. If you further experiencing any PNL transmission loss, please get back to us.

The following mail received from our Customer Services Duty Manager. If you remember I had previously spoken to you about the same problem (Duplication of Group code)



The ADDL list of PNL duplicates the Group code, thereby you will have more than one group with the same code. (Please refer to flight G9 283 of yesterday - 04 MAR 09 you will find 3 groups under code A - A34, A9 and A2. Surprisingly the PNR is also duplicated. If you look at the PNR for group A34 and A9 it is the same 17092289. However, close scrutiny shows that group A9 is part of A34, and has been added first and then deleted.



Further as mentioned in the mail the inbound figure from Muscat for the same flight is shown as 34 passengers, whereas actual figure is only 6.



As you go through the mail there seems to be some discrepancy in the PNR allotted to the passenger. On G9 323 of today - 05 MAR 09, you have a Group with code A as 2 but the actual number of passengers are 11 with same PNR under group A2, which you will agree, is quite abnormal.



Most of the discrepancies seem to originate from the Additional Lists of the PNL .



These discrepancies have resulted in total confusion as well as wrong check in / delays to the flights.



Can you please look into the matter and advise? I feel this is a problem at Reservations level, but if your investigations reveal that the problem is from SITA please let me know so that I can advise them accordingly.



Thanks and regards

Subject: RE: Re 6Q1453 W09



Hello Khaled,

I think you misunderstand my request.

It is fine to send the PNL 24hours before STD or 12 as you state.

But the date in the PNL should be the same as STD in local time.

I will give you an example.

6Q1453 is departing (local time) 22NOV 00:30 but the date in the PNL is 21NOV...

We then have to rename all PNL to have it in the system for flight 22NOV!

Further to our earlier emails on the subject. 



Following reported by our Duty Manager, Customer Services. As it is apparent, there are two issues:

1. Allocation of same group code for more than one group, which causes confusion at the check-in level as well as at the time of offloading, to identify the passenger / baggage.

2. Same PNR for more than one group.



On G9 111 / 11MAR09 (flight under reference), if you retrieve the passenger through PNR, the list is of 15 passengers with three different group with code B (B3, B8 and B2)



We feel that the problem needs to be addressed on an urgent basis since this could lead to delays / discrepancies on the flights.



As advised in the earlier email, it is felt that the problem is initiated with ADD list which starts allocating group code afresh without taking into account the codes in the main PNL.



Thanks and Regards

Dear Mr. Byond,



Passenger booked on the above mentioned flight under PNR 16925982 purchased seat number 1A along with his ticket. However, we' were not able to give the same seat to the pax since he didn't have a name on SDCS system although he is a confirmed pax therefore the seat was not protected in the system but was appearing as available hence was utilized by another pax. Same has created a seating conflict onboard and resulted in delaying the flight for 10m.



The PNL of the above mentioned flight was not downloaded completely onto the SDCS system i.e. out of 160 pax booked we had around 84 names reflecting in the system only meaning we had to accept the rest of the pax (around 74) as no-rec!!



Appreciate if you can investigate the matter and find out what went wrong.

1. Currency Maintenance
When split and change dates of an existing rate, to update a rate effective within minutes, date displayed on the screen get advanced by 1 day. Therefore validation force user to key in a day 1 day future and after save, displayed date get changed current date.
==> NOT OK. Standard issue. 

2. Added a open return booking as on hold. 
Issue 1 - Once a open return booking added, not possible to change outgoing date before return date is confirmed. 
==> NOT OK. As discussed, needs to address soon. 

Added another return segment with return date confirmed. Confirmed changes from payment page without making payment. 
Issue 2 - 2nd segment should be displayed as 2 separate segments, but screen showing these as single segment like in open return. 
==> NOT OK 
Issue 3 - when 2nd group selected, no modify segment, only 'Confirm Segment' displayed. 
==> NOT OK 
Issue 4 - After a payment also, 2nd return group remain as 1 segment.
==> NOT OK 

3. Modify Reservation
Cannot see the buttons on the screen. Screen had been re-adjusted? 

Advance Search - new search criteria 'BC Type' added and when a search is done, results are showing only the segments with selected BC type. Should show the full booking details, not only the segments matching searched BC.
==> NOT OK 

Made a open return booking and canceled. After that added new segment. In the flight availability screen flight details displayed with a flight selected. Fare Quote and Book buttons are displayed, but no fare Quote. 
This happens when 'Add Segment' search is for a connection. 
For single segments this is ok.
==> NOT OK 


4. Flight Manifest 
Not showing any open return segments. This is correct. Why are we showing legend for BC as ""Open Return #""??
